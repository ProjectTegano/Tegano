DOCUMENT PROCESSING

Wolframe is not enveloping requests. The decision what to do with a processing request is defined only
by the document metadata and an action identifier you optionally specify with the request.

A command processed is defined by a action prefix that can be empty and the document type idenfifier.
The document type identifier is extracted from the document meta data.

The rules how to get to one document type identifier are currently either extracted from the
!DOCTYPE definition if present or derived from the xsi:schemaLocation root element attribute.
Schema definition namespaces are currently not respected, but will be in the future.

At the end of the document type recognition the system knows what function to call.
