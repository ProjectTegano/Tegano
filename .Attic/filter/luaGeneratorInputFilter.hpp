/**
Idea of a filter based on a lua function returning v,t tuples
Given up.
Does not work according my current Lua knowlegde because the called function must not yield.
Yielding is not allowed across C/Lua function boundaries, e.g. Lua calling C, calling Lua that yields
execution. This makes it to be a dangerous feature. It raises more questions than it answers.
Therefore it is not implemented.
