UIForm
------

Contains the XML for rendering the Form, it's exactly the
thing I can load into Qt 'designer'
The schema is in 'qt-ui-4.7.xsd'.

Currently those are the files in 'forms'.

Should be cashed on the client.

UIFormTranslation
-----------------

language: de_CH, en_US, etc.

source:

Currently using the Qt translation format, version 2.0
(files with extentions .ts in directory 'i18n').
Could also be gettext PO files and others.

binary:

Lookup tables similar to gettext MO files. Those are used
productive at runtime to translate the forms.

Should be cashed on the client.

UIStylesheet
------------

A Qt stylesheet similar to CSS in HTML influencing the look-and-feel
of the form widgets. Syntax check not really possible (maybe with
a QSS-loader and interpreter program?). The format is plain text ASCII.

Currently in the 'themes/XXX/' directory as '*.qss' files.

The Qt designer currently doesn't load and apply external stylesheets, only 
manual local style changes to widgets are possible.

Can also be embedded as a top-level form property 'styleSheet' directly into
the form, but then we get an DRY-problem! So this is just an option for 
rendering/designing as a transitional format! Unless of couse we use one
theme UI loading may form UIs..

Should be cashed on the client.

Domain data
-----------

Currently the *.xml files in the 'data' directory. Per form and widget
there is a XML file containing the pickable values.

Could be embedded in the UI, but translations get complicated this way.

Could be big, so paging and partial model updates could be an issue
(think a million cities and a completion widget).

Domain data gets choosen based on the current interface language.

Simple schema:

<domain>
   <form>form1</form>
   <widget>widget1</widget>
   <language>de_CH</language>
   <values>
      <value id="language_independent_key">translated value</value>
      ...
   </values>
</domain>

Those could also be forms..

Should not be cached on the client.

Current data
------------

Those are forms..

Must not be cached on the client.

Theme
-----

Currently those are the files in 'themes/XXX'. They just contain an
empty main window and some menu hooks.

Are not a class per se. They are a form (with a menu and statusbar) and
a stylesheet and some translations. Can be seen as a special form. They
may also disappear completly and all data is contained in each UIForm
(makes the loading process a little bit more tricky).
