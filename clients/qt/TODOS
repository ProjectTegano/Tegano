- use QNetworkSession (for mobiles and roaming profiles)
- localize forms:
  - there should be no need to copy them just for localization
- investigate why auto-wiring failed in the past
- add a data handler
  - simplest form is read data as XML from a directory (as for
    the forms)
    - naming convention to glue the values to string properties
    - where to put things like validators? (mandatory field,
      isnumber, regex, etc.)
  - save data back to this directory
  - first step is to edit a singleton object like one user in
    one form
  - then 1:n relations (pick a foreign reference to another
    object), domains (e.g. pick a city in a list of possibilities)
  - then comes grid views
- attach the WolframeClient also to the simple file based form
  and data loader, to test the debugging window
