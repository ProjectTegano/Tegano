- use QNetworkSession (for mobiles and roaming profiles)
- localize forms:
  - Windows doesn't retranslate on the fly! Why?
  - Windows doesn't respect language on startup for form
- localize data:
  - lists and trees need id and translations.
  - where to store the translations? server side, same as domains,
    maybe language attributes for now and separated translations later?
- designer mode
  - call designer, linguist, lupdate and lrelease as external processes
  - have a spooler to delegate editing of ui, ts, qss, data to external processes
    - multiple repositores, move objects between them
    - sqlite storage
    - configuration dialog
    - http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/computing/sepp-irix/qt-3.0-mo/designer-manual-6.html
- add a data handler
  - better form of buttons/action handling
    - send/get/reset
    - support actions like: insert new/edit existing/delete
  - simplest form is read data as XML from a directory (as for
    the forms)
    - classes to map from/to:
      - QListWidget
        - localization
      - QTreeWidget
        - localization
        - reorganize tree
          - add elements 
          - move elements/subtrees
          - delete elements/subtrees
      - QListView: with model for big data, on request
      - QTreeView: with model for big data, on request
      - file upload: we need that for product images, etc.
      - file download
        - FileChooser as designer custom widget
    - completion
      - combobox with linedit combined search
      - lists? trees?
    - where to put things like validators? (mandatory field,
      isnumber, regex, etc.):
      - special custom property in ui description file
      - pass it as form data
    - tooltips?
    - how to handle domain enums with internal and presentation
      (e.g. combobox, selection)
    - representation of lists of variable size, e.g. list of
      phone numbers
    - states (enable/disabled, read/write or read/only) can depend
      on states of other widgets, best example is a checked group
      box for a bunch of settings, see preferences dialog)
  - 1:n relations (pick a foreign reference to another
    object), domains (e.g. pick a city in a list of possibilities)
  - grid views
- stop flickering in hour glas
- QIODevice for data loader and handler instead of a fixed byte
  array in the signal (otherwise the debug window gets complicated)
- network loader via protocol or use client library?
- add authentication dialog
