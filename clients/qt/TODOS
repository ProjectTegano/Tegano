- use QNetworkSession (for mobiles and roaming profiles)
- localize forms:
  - Windows doesn't retranslate on the fly! Why?
  - Windows doesn't respect language on startup for form
- localize data:
  - lists and trees need id and translations.
  - where to store the translations? server side, same as domains,
    maybe language attributes for now and separated translations later?
- add a data handler
  - better form of buttons/action handling
    - send/get/reset
    - support actions like: insert new/edit existing/delete
  - simplest form is read data as XML from a directory (as for
    the forms)
    - classes to map from/to:
      - QListWidget: localization
      - QTreeWidget: localization
      - QListView: with model for big data, on request
      - QTreeView: with model for big data, on request
      - file upload: we need that for product images, etc.
      - file download
    - completion
      - combobox with linedit combined search
      - lists? trees?
    - where to put things like validators? (mandatory field,
      isnumber, regex, etc.):
      - special custom property in ui description file
      - pass it as form data
    - tooltips?
    - how to handle domain enums with internal and presentation
      (e.g. combobox, selection)
    - representation of lists of variable size, e.g. list of
      phone numbers
  - 1:n relations (pick a foreign reference to another
    object), domains (e.g. pick a city in a list of possibilities)
  - grid views
- QIODevice for data loader and handler instead of a fixed byte
  array in the signal (otherwise the debug window gets complicated)
- attach the DebugWindow also to the simple file based form
  and data loader, to test the debugging window. Needs line peeking
  and rewinding QIODevice
