- use QNetworkSession (for mobiles and roaming profiles)
- localize forms:
  - there should be no need to copy them just for localization
- investigate why auto-wiring failed in the past
- add a data handler
  - simplest form is read data as XML from a directory (as for
    the forms)
    - classes to map from/to:
      - grouped QRadioButtons: exclusive, select one item from
        a small list of possible items in a domain
      - grouped QCheckBoxes: multiple select in a small list of
        items
      - QListView: list of things to select (multiple select)
      - QPlainTextEdit: tags in rich text?
      - QTreeWidget
      - file upload
      - file download
    - where to put things like validators? (mandatory field,
      isnumber, regex, etc.)
    - tooltips?
    - how to handle domain enums with internal and presentation
      (e.g. combobox, selection)
    - representation of lists of variable size, e.g. list of
      phone numbers
  - 1:n relations (pick a foreign reference to another
    object), domains (e.g. pick a city in a list of possibilities)
  - grid views
- QIODevice for data loader and handler instead of a fixed byte
  array in the signal (otherwise the debug window gets complicated)
- attach the DebugWindow also to the simple file based form
  and data loader, to test the debugging window. Needs line peeking
  and rewinding QIODevice
- workflow
  - save, cancel of form (first step)
