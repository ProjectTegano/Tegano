- use QNetworkSession (for mobiles and roaming profiles)
- localize forms:
  - Windows doesn't retranslate on the fly! Why?
  - Domain names like 'male', 'female', separate view localized form
    and use something different internally, also, should the domains
    come from the ui or as a separate request?
- add a data handler
  - simplest form is read data as XML from a directory (as for
    the forms)
    - classes to map from/to:
      - QListWidget: localization
      - QTreeWidget: map XML elements in columns, map hierarchies,
        we need that for categorization
      - file upload: we need that for product images, etc.
      - file download
    - where to put things like validators? (mandatory field,
      isnumber, regex, etc.)
    - tooltips?
    - how to handle domain enums with internal and presentation
      (e.g. combobox, selection)
    - representation of lists of variable size, e.g. list of
      phone numbers
  - 1:n relations (pick a foreign reference to another
    object), domains (e.g. pick a city in a list of possibilities)
  - grid views
- QIODevice for data loader and handler instead of a fixed byte
  array in the signal (otherwise the debug window gets complicated)
- attach the DebugWindow also to the simple file based form
  and data loader, to test the debugging window. Needs line peeking
  and rewinding QIODevice
