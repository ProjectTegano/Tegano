1) Install and configure the PAM backend

A very simple backend is a plain password file like

https://github.com/tiwe-de/libpam-pwdfile

Note: Do not try to test with pam_unix or a similar module, you
can't access /etc/shadow as normal user!

2) Create user

Build 'genpwd' with:

gcc -l crypt -o genpwd genpwd.c

Use 'genpwd' to generate a hash for a file called
'/etc/wolframeusers' with user 'wolfusr' and password 'wolfpwd':

wolfusr:$1$3glYHJaH$n2HsIXJg9dRW7vbegCC2B/

3) Configure PAM system

Create a '/etc/pam.d/wolframe' and add:

#%PAM-1.0

auth    required        pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile=/etc/wolframeusers debug
account         required        pam_permit.so
session         required        pam_permit.so
password        required        pam_deny.so

This way debugging the PAM requests is quite easy.

4) PAM test

'pamTest' is currently not executed automatically due to those system
requirements. Jailing/fakeroot could be an option..
