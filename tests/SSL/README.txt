Generate a CA certificate:
  openssl req -config openssl.cnf -days 1825 -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
              -out CA.cert.pem -keyout CA.key.pem -outform PEM

  openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -nodes -keyout wolframed.key \
              -out wolframed.req -days 365

  openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -policy policy_anything -out wolframed.crt \

NOTE: If you want a certificate valid for multiple hostnames, IPs ...,
create a file having subjectAltName=.... and sign the certificate 
with -extfile filename. The openssl.cnf must have req_extensions = v3_req uncommented
