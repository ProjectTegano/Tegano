reorganization of qtclient
--------------------------

libwolframeclient:

- currently the client library with protocol and SSL
- in the future authentication plugins:
  - using QCA for
    - SASL
    - some cyphers and hash functions
    - certificate handling
  - using QOauth for OAuth authentication
- have plugins for various marshalling of data
  - use QVariant, QVariantList and QVariantMap as the lingua franca
  - XML (XML parser of Qt)
  - JSON (QJson, libqt4json, Qt5 JSON integrated library)
  
skeleton:

- basic skeleton
- using libwolframewidgets

wolframewidgets:

- the qt designer plugins for Wolframe specific widgets
- currently implemented plugins
  - FileChooser (single and multiple file upload, picking a directory)
  - PictureChooser (picture preview and upload)
- in the future
  - PicturePicker (preview of a list pictures and single and multiple
    selection)

qtclient:

- the generic client
- built using libwolframeclient and skeleton (as a test case)
- using plugins from wolframewidgets (dynamically, not as now hardcoded!)
