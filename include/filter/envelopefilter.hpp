/// \file filter/envelopefilter.hpp
/// \brief Filter serving as envelope for a typed filter with some addtionional context data. Used for functions that return a result of a function called as their own result. They need to add their closure so that it not get freed while the result is still processed by the caller.
/// \remark Most scenarios where a function returns a result of an other function as its own needs an envelope of this kind to avoid data reference deadlocks.
