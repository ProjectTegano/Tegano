This is a local copy of MPFR. Nothing has been changed but adding
compilation on Windows using native tools NMAKE.EXE and CL.EXE, LINK.EXE
The autoconf and porting directories have been removed, they are available
from the official download site of MPFR.

Currently we don't use assembly at all, only functions in generic.
On Windows only Intel processors are of interest anyway:
so mparam.h is the generic/mparam.h
