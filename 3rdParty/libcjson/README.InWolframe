Local changes for cJSON in Wolframe
-----------------------------------

- renamed test.c to testit.c (avoid collision with 'test' phony target),
  heavily fixed to pass a C compiler, reactivated file-based tests
- added a cJSON_Context and removed global variable for error position to make the library thread-safe
- removed GetErrorPtr and use the variable errorptr in cJSON_Context as last error info
- return Number type elements also as string transformation is done by normalization in forms
