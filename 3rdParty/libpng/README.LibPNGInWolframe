1.6.9 Vanilla, unpatched

Used on Windows only to build libpng (we have only NMAKE support here).
Use the official libpng libraries on all other platforms.

Local changes:

  * Added 'Makefile.W32' to build in Wolframe style

  * removed examples, man page, autoconf support, etc. kept only source
    and header files of libpng
