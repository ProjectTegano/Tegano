Lua 5.2 Vanilla, unpatched

Makefile has been renamed to 'Makefile.orig'.

'GNUmakefile' and 'Makefile.w32' are added for the
Wolframe project.

The CFLAGS should be the same as in the original Makefile.

The define switch for creating DLLs is called 'BUILD_SHARED' in
Wolframe. We use it in 'luaconf.h' to trigger the correct
DLL function markers as in:

#if defined(LUA_BUILD_AS_DLL) || defined(BUILD_SHARED)	/* { */
