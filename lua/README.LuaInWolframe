Lua 5.1.4 with LuaCoco 1.1.6 patch integrated

Don't use the lua from the system, it won't work!

Makefile has been renamed to 'Makefile.orig'.
LUA_PLATFORM flag is set in 'platform.mk' and passed as
PLAT=$(LUA_PLATFORM) parameter to the original
makefile.

'GNUmakefile' and 'Makefile.w32' are added for the
Wolframe projects.
