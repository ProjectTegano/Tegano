[1]- Database constructors are not exception save:
	Cntrl-C at startup -> exception "ObjectPool not empty at destruction" leaves a bad impression.
	Solution:
		1) Either make Object Pool exception save and let it cleanup on its own (only allowing object references of a base class with virtual destructor)
		2) Or put initialization/deinitialization into functions and call deinitialization in a catchg in the DB constructor

[2]- TransactionFunctionClosure: serialize::Context::CaseInsensitiveCompare not respected
	(too difficult at the moment and most databases are case insensitive anyway) !

[4]- Oracle propagation of caseinsensitivity does not work somehow (broken chain of propagating flags)

[5]- Bug: Crash on windows (result of endless loop ?) if form function result filter does not return final close. Do test on linux first, if it appears also. Windows is difficult
