[1]- Database constructors are not exception save:
	Cntrl-C at startup -> exception "ObjectPool not empty at destruction" leaves a bad impression.
	Solution:
		1) Either make Object Pool exception save and let it cleanup on its own (only allowing object references of a base class with virtual destructor)
		2) Or put initialization/deinitialization into functions and call deinitialization in a catchg in the DB constructor

[2]- Errors on ARM because char defaults to unsigned char instead of signed char:
	1) Tons of warnings about superflous comparisons of unsigned chars
	2) base64Test fails in base64 decoding
	3) textwolf always throws an InvalidParam

[3]- TransactionFunctionClosure: serialize::Context::CaseInsensitiveCompare not respected
	(too difficult at the moment and most databases are case insensitive anyway) !
