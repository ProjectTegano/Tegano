openSuse 11.4:
counterTest: /usr/include/boost/thread/pthread/mutex.hpp:47:
boost::mutex::~mutex(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_destroy(&m)' failed.

all platforms:
protocol \r\n of the EOD "\r\n.\r\n" is passed as content to the 
processor. This creates problems (funny characters at the end of data
for wide character set inputs. The problem is not easy to solve but 
will be fixed sooner as possible. :-)
