- minimal config is a config with 2 config elements?! weird..
  => check for XML first, use some simple validating parser (Patrick has one)
- what is a minimal server config? Either I get errors or the server
  silently doesn't start! This is not user-friendly..
  => first action is always to add a logging section (to stderr)

- Connection 1: on timeout we loose connection from the pool!
  telnet localhost 7661
  Trying ::1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  Wolframe version 0.0.5 OS
  OK
  Timeout. :P
  Connection closed by foreign host.
  abaumann@eeepc:~/projects/Wolframe/src> telnet localhost 7661
  Trying ::1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  Server is busy. Please try again later.
  Connection closed by foreign host.
  MBa: the problem is that a connection is removed twice from the list in case of a timeout.
  Have to fix that, quick hack for now.

- themes/windows directory is requires and the files, maybe a
  builtin compiled standard theme is an idea?
