- minimal config is a config with 2 config elements?! weird..
  => check for XML first, use some simple validating parser (Patrick has one)
- what is a minimal server config? Either I get errors or the server
  silently doesn't start! This is not user-friendly..
  => first action is always to add a logging section (to stderr)
- why is 'ServerTokens' required?
- Connection 1: on timeout we loose connection from the pool!
  telnet localhost 7661

  OK
  Timeout. :P

- themes/windows directory is requires and the files, maybe a
  builtin compiled standard theme is an idea?
- an empty list of results is not the same as a list with one empty tag:
  <list><customer/></list>
