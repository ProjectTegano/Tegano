local changes and fixes:
- Makefile has been renamed to 'Makefile.orig'.

  Wolframe project.
- Source/OpenEXR/IlmImf/ImfAutoArray.h:
  added include for <string.h> for memset
- Windows
  - 'Source/FreeImage.h': added BUILD_SHARED wrapper to switch
    /DFREEIMAGE_LIB for symbol tagging (so we can build static
    and dynamic libraries in the same directory)
