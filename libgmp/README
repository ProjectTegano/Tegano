This is a local copy of libgmp. Nothing has been changed but adding
compilation on Windows using native tools NMAKE.EXE and CL.EXE, LINK.EXE
The autoconf and porting directories have been removed, they are available
from the official download site of libgmp.

Some sources had to be adapted due to compiler trouble or funny ideas:

- Applied trick as in mpir on popham.c:
  - popcount.c is a copy of popham.c with OPERATION_popcount defined
  - hamdist.c is a copy of popham.c with OPERATION_hamdist defined

Currently we don't use assembly at all, only functions in generic.
On Windows only Intel processors are of interest anyway..
