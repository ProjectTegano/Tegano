		<para><application>Wolframe</application> application server requests consist of a named command and a structured
		content (document) as argument.</para>
		<para>In this chapter we describe how <application>Wolframe</application> application server requests are
		processed. You will understand the inwolved bricks of software and how they are configured to build
		the backend of your <application>Wolframe</application> application.
		</para>
		<para>The following illustration shows the processing of one client request to the server.
			A call of the <application>Wolframe</application> logic tier gets to a command handler
			that calls functions given by the provider to perform the transaction
			requested.
