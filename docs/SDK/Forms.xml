<title>Forms</title>
<para>This chapter describes how form data schemas are linked to the logic tier. It introduces a data description
language (DDL) called <code>simpleform</code> that allows you to specify data schemas with the validation and 
normalization of atomic types. It also describes the <code>Wolframe</code> module concept for form descriptions that 
allows you to add a compiler for your existing data schemas.
</para>
<para>
After reading this chapter you should be able to write data forms of <code>Wolframe</code> of the  logic tier 
in the <code>simpleform</code> data description language on your own. You should also know how a new data description
language (DDL) could be added.
</para>
<para>
Be aware that you have to configure a data description language type (DDL compiler) of the logic tier 
in <code>Wolframe</code> before using it. Each chapter introducing a data form description language will have 
a section that describes how the server configuration of <code>Wolframe</code> has to be extended for its availability.
