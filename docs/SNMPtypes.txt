OID DataTypes

SMI defines a fixed number of datatypes which are returned by OIDs. These datatypes include:

Integer
    Signed 32bit Integer (values between -2147483648 and 2147483647). 
Integer32
    Same as Integer. 
UInteger32
    Unsigned 32bit Integer (values between 0 and 4294967295). 
Octet String
    Arbitrary binary or textual data, typically limited to 255 characters in length. 
Object Identifier
    An OID. 
Bit String
    Represents an enumeration of named bits. This is an unsigned datatype. 
IpAddress
    An IP address. 
Counter32
    Represents a non-negative integer which monotonically increases until it reaches a maximum value of 32bits-1 (4294967295 dec), when it wraps around and starts increasing again from zero. 
Counter64
    Same as Counter32 but has a maximum value of 64bits-1. 
Gauge32
    Represents an unsigned integer, which may increase or decrease, but shall never exceed a maximum value. 
TimeTicks
    Represents an unsigned integer which represents the time, modulo 232 (4294967296 dec), in hundredths of a second between two epochs. 
Opaque
    Provided solely for backward-compatibility, its no longer used. 
NsapAddress
    Represents an OSI address as a variable-length OCTET STRING.
