	<para>This part of the manual describes how the user interface part (presentation tier or client) of
	<application>Wolframe</application> applications can be built.
	</para>
	<para>A <application>Wolframe</application> client can be of various kinds. They all communicate with the server over
	a text based protocol in a plain or encrypted session. All methods used are based on open standards.
	</para>
	<para>We will introduce some examples of clients: The <application>Wolframe</application> 
	standard client written in Qt (C++), a .NET client written in C# and a web
	client written in PHP communicating via a web server with the 
	<application>Wolframe</application> application server.
	</para>
	<para>

	<application>Wolframe</application> client based of one of these
	examples on your own.
