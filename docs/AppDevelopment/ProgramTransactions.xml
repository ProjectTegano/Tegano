<title>Transactions in TDL</title>
	<sect2>
		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			For the description of transactions <application>Wolframe</application> provides the
			transaction definition language (<acronym>TDL</acronym>) introduced here.
			<application>Wolframe</application> transactions in <acronym>TDL</acronym> are defined as functions in a
			transactional context. This means that whatever is executed in a transaction function
			belongs by default to a database transaction with an automatic commit on function completion
			if not explicitly defined otherwise by the caller. Errors lead to an automatic abort
			of the database transaction.
		</para>
		<para>
			A <acronym>TDL</acronym> transaction function takes a structure as input
			and returns a structure as output.
			The <application>Wolframe</application> database interface defines 
			a transaction as object where the input is passed to as a structure 
			and the output is fetched from it as a structure.
		</para>
		<para>
			TDL is a language to describe the building of transaction 
			input and the building of the result structure from the database output.
			It defines a transaction as a sequence of instructions on multiple data.
			An instruction is either described as a single embedded database command
			in the language of the underlying database, a name of a function declared
			in the database (e.g. a PLSQL function) or a TDL subroutine call
			working on multiple data.
		</para>
		<para>
			Working on multiple data means that the instruction is executed
			for every item of an input set. This set can consist of the set of
			results of a previous instruction or a selection of the
			input of the transaction function. A "for each" selector
			defines the input set as part of the command.
		</para>
		<para>
			Each instruction result can be declared as being part of the transaction
			result structure. The language has no control structures and is 
			therefore not a general purpose programming language.
			It just offers some mapping of the input to commands and from the command 
			results back to the output.
		</para>
		<para>
			To convert input data the transaction definition language 
			defines a preprocessing section where globally defined Wolframe
			functions can be called for the selected input. To build an output 
			structure that cannot be modeled with a language without control
			structures and recursion, TDL provides the possibility to define a
			function as filter for postprocessing of the
			result of the transaction function.
		</para>
		<para>
			The TDL is case insensitive. For clearness and better readability
			TDL keywords are written in uppercase here.
		</para>

	<title>Configuration</title>
		<para>
		Each TDL program source referenced has to be declared in the <code>Processor</code>
		section of the configuration with <code>program &lt;sourcefile&gt;</code>.
		</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2>
	<title>Language Description</title>
		<para>
		A TDL program consists of subroutine declarations and exported
		transaction function declarations. Subroutines have the same
		structure as transaction function blocks but without pre- and postprocessing
		and authorization method declarations.
		</para>
		<sect3>
			<title>Subroutines</title>
			<para>A subroutine declaration starts with the Keyword <code>SUBROUTINE</code>
			followed by the subroutine name and optionally some parameter names
			in brackets ('(' ')') separated by comma.
			The declared subroutine name identifies the
			function in the scope of this sourcefile after this subroutine declaration.
			The name is not exported and the subroutine not available for other TDL
			modules. The body of the function contains the following parts:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><code>DATABASE &lt;database name list&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional definition is restriction the definition
						and availability of the function to a set of
						databases. The databases are listed by name
						separated by comma (','). The names are the
						database id's defined in your server configuration.
						If the database declaration is omitted then the 
						transaction function is avaiable for any 
						database. This declaration allows you to
						run your application with configurations
						using different databases but sharing a common
						code base.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>RESULT INTO &lt;result-block-name&gt; FILTER &lt;post-filter-name&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional declaration defines a tag for the
						result structure relative to the result context
						of the caller.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>BEGIN &lt;...instructions...&gt; END</code>
					<para>
					The main processing block starts with <code>BEGIN</code> and
					ends with <code>END</code>. It contains all the commands
					executed when calling this subroutine from another
					subroutine or a transaction function.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			The following pseudocode example shows the parts of a subroutine declaration:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			SUBROUTINE &lt;name&gt; ( &lt;parameter name list&gt; )
			DATABASE &lt;list of database names&gt;
			RESULT INTO &lt;result-block-name&gt;
			BEGIN
				...&lt;instructions&gt;...
			END
			</programlisting>
			The line with the RESULT INTO declaration and the DATABASE declaration are optional.
			</para>
		</sect3>

		<sect3>
			<title>Transaction Function Declarations</title>
			<para>A transaction function declaration starts with the Keyword <code>TRANSACTION</code>
			followed by the name of the transaction function. This name identifies the
			function globally. The body of the function contains the following parts:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><code>AUTHORIZE ( &lt;auth-function&gt;, &lt;auth-resource&gt; )</code>
					<para>
						This optional definition is dealing with 
						authorization and access rights.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>DATABASE &lt;database name list&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional definition is restriction the definition
						and availability of the function to a set of
						databases. The databases are listed by name
						separated by comma (','). The names are the
						database id's defined in your server configuration.
						If the database declaration is omitted then the 
						transaction function is avaiable for any 
						database. This declaration allows you to
						run your application with configurations
						using different databases but sharing a common
						code base.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>RESULT INTO &lt;result-block-name&gt; FILTER &lt;post-filter-name&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional declaration defines a top level tag for the 
						result structure and optionally a postprocessing step as
						filter referenced by name.
						It is similar as the construct in the subroutine description
						except that one cannot specify a postprocessing filter
						in a subroutine.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>PREPROC &lt;...preprocessing instructions...&gt; ENDPROC</code>
					<para>
						This optional block contains instructions on the transaction
						function input. The result of these preprocessing instructions are
						put into the input structure, so that they can be referred to in the main
						code definition block of the transaction.
						We can call any global normalization or form function in the 
						preprocessing block to enrich or transform the input to process.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>BEGIN &lt;...instructions...&gt; END</code>
					<para>
					The main processing block starts with <code>BEGIN</code> and
					ends with <code>END</code>. It contains all the database instructions
					needed for completing this transaction.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			The following pseudo code snippet shows the explained building
			blocks in transaction functions together:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
	
			TRANSACTION &lt;name&gt;
			AUTHORIZE ( &lt;auth-function&gt;, &lt;auth-resource&gt; )
			DATABASE &lt;list of database names&gt;
			RESULT INTO &lt;result-block-name&gt; FILTER &lt;post-filter-name&gt;
			PREPROC
				...&lt;preprocessing instructions&gt;...
			ENDPROC
			BEGIN
				...&lt;instructions&gt;...
			END
			</programlisting>
			The lines with AUTHORIZE,DATABASE,RESULT INTO and FILTER are optional.
			So is the preprocessing block PREPROC..ENDPROC. A simpler
			transaction function looks like the following:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
	
			TRANSACTION &lt;name&gt;
			BEGIN
				...&lt;instructions&gt;...
			END
			</programlisting>
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Main Processing Instructions</title>
			<para>Main processing instructions defined in the main execution block 
			of a subroutine or transaction function consist of three parts in the
			following order terminated by a semicolon ';' (the order of the 
			INTO and FOREACH expression can be switched):
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><code>INTO &lt;result substructure name&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional directive specifies if and where the results
						of the database commands should be put into as part of the
						function output. In subroutines this substructure is
						relative to the current substructure addressed in the
						callers context.
						For example a subroutine with an "INTO myres"
						directive called by a subroutine with an "INTO output"
						directive will write its result into a substructure with path
						"output/myres".
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>FOREACH &lt;selector&gt;</code>
					<para>
						This optional directive defines the set of 
						elements on which the instruction is executed one by one.
						Specifying a set of two elements will cause the function to
						be called twice. An empty set as selection will
						cause the instruction to be ignored. Without
						quantifier the database command or subroutine call
						of the instruction will be always be executed once.
					</para>
					<para>
						The argument of the FOREACH expression is either
						a reference to the result of a previous 
						instruction or a path selecting a set of input
						elements.
					</para>
					<para>
						Results of previous instructions are referenced either with
						the keyword RESULT referring to the result set
						of the previous command or with a variable
						naming a result set declared with this name before.
						
					</para>
						Input elements are selected by path relative
						to the path currently selected, starting from
						the input root element when entering a transaction
						function. The current path selected and the base
						element of any relative path calculated in this scope
						changes when a subroutine is called in a FOREACH selection
						context. For example calling a subroutine in a
						'FOREACH person' context will cause
						relative paths in this subroutine to be sub elements
						of 'person'.
					<para>
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>DO &lt;command&gt;</code>
					<para>
						Commands in an instruction are either embedded
						database commands, named database functions (e.g. PLSQL functions)
						or subroutine calls. Command arguments
						are either constants or relative paths 
						from the selector path in the FOREACH selection
						or referring to elements in the result of 
						a previous command.
						If an argument is a relative path from the 
						selector context, its reference
						has to be unique in the context of the 
						element selected by the selector.
						If an argument references a previous command
						result it must either be unique or dependent
						an the FOREACH argument. 
						Results that are sets with more than one element
						can only be referenced if they are bound to 
						the FOREACH quantifier.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<sect4>
				<title>Main Processing Example</title>
				<para>The following example illustrate how the FOREACH,INTO,DO
				expressions in the main processing block work together:
				<programlisting language='sql'>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_mainprocessing.tdl" parse="text" />
				</programlisting>
				</para>
			</sect4>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
		<title>Preprocessing Instructions</title>
		<para>Preprocessing instructions defined in the PREPROC execution block 
			of a transaction function consist similar to the instructions
			in the main execution block of three parts in the
			following order terminated by a semicolon ';' (the order of the INTO and FOREACH expression can be
			switched):
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><code>INTO &lt;result substructure name&gt;</code>
				<para>
					This optional directive specifies if and where the results
					of the preprocessing commands should be put into as part
					of the input to be processed by the main processing
					instructions. The relative paths of the destination structure
					are calculated relative to a FOREACH selection element.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem><code>FOREACH &lt;selector&gt;</code>
				<para>
					This optional directive defines the set of 
					elements on which the instruction is executed one by one.
					The preprocessing command is executed once for each 
					element in the selected set and it will not be executed 
					at all if the selected set is empty.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem><code>DO &lt;command&gt;</code>
				<para>
					Commands in an instruction are function calls to
					globally defined form functions or normalization
					functions. Command arguments
					are constants or relative paths from the selector
					path in the FOREACH selection. They are uniquely
					referencing elements in the context of a selected element.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		</para>
			<sect4>
				<title>Preprocessing Example</title>
				<para>The following example illustrate how the "FOREACH, INTO, DO"
				expressions in the main processing block work together:
				<programlisting language='sql'>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_preprocessing.tdl" parse="text" />
				</programlisting>
				</para>
			</sect4>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
		<title>Selector Path</title>
		<para>An element of the input or a set of input elements can be selected by a path.
			A path is a sequence of one of the following elements separated by slashes:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>Identifier
				<para>
				An identifier uniquely selects a sub element of the current position in the tree.
				</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>*</code>
				<para>
				An asterisk selects any sub element of the current position in the tree.
				</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>..</code>
				<para>
				Two dots in a row select the parent element of the current position in the tree.
				</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>.</code>
				<para>
				One dots selects the current element in the tree.
				This operator can also be useful as part of a path
				to force the expression to be interpreted
				as path if it could also be interpreted as a keyword of the 
				TDL language (for example <code>./RESULT</code>).
				</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			A slash at the beginning of a path selects the root element of the transaction function input tree.
			Two subsequent slashes express that the following node is (transitively) any descendant of the
			current node in the tree.
		</para>
		<para>
			Paths can appear as argument of a FOREACH selector where they specify
			the set of elements on which the attached command is executed on.
			Or they can appear as reference to an argument in a command expression
			where they specify uniquely one element that is passed as argument 
			to the command when it is executed.
		</para>
		<para>
			When used in embedded database statements, selector paths are referenced
			with <code>$(&lt;path expression&gt;)</code>. When used as database
			function or subroutine call arguments path expressions can be used in
			plain without '$' and '(' ')' markers. These markers are just used to 
			identify substitution entities.
		</para>
			<sect4>
			<title>Path Expression Examples</title>
				<para>The following list shows different ways of addressing an element by path:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><code>/</code>
					<para>Root element</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>/organization</code>
					<para>Root element with name "organization"</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>/organization/address/city</code>
					<para>Element "city" of root "organization" descendant "address"</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>.//id</code>
					<para>Any descendant element with name "id" of the current element</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>//person/id</code>
					<para>Child with name "id" of any descendant "person" of the root element</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>//id</code>
					<para>Any descendant element with name "id" of the root element</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>/address/*</code>
					<para>Any direct descendant of the root element "address"</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem><code>.</code>
					<para>Currently selected element</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				</para>

			<title>Path Usage Example</title>
			<para>This example shows the usage of path expression in the
			preprocessing and the main processing part of a transaction function:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/selectors_example.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			</sect4>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Referencing Database Results</title>
			<para>Database results of the previous instruction are referenced 
			with a '$RESULT.' followed by the column identifier or column number.
			Column numbers start always from 1, independent from the database!
			So be aware that even if the database counts column from 0 you have
			to use 1 for the first column. 
			</para>
			<para>
			As already explained before, database result sets of cardinality 
			bigger than one cannot be addressed if not bound to a FOREACH
			selection. In statements potentially addressing more than one 
			result element you have to add a <code>FOREACH RESULT</code> quantifier.
			</para>
			<para>
			For addressing results of instructions preceding the previous instruction,
			you have to name them (see next section). The name of the result can then
			be used as FOREACH argument to select the elements of a set to be
			used as base for the command arguments of the instruction. Without
			binding instruction commands with a FOREACH quantifier the named 
			results of an instruction can be referenced as
			<code>$&lt;name&gt;.&lt;columnref&gt;</code>,
			for example as <code>$person.id</code> for the column with name 'id' of the
			result named as 'person'.
			</para>
			<para>
			The 'RESULT.' prefix in references to the previous instruction result
			is a default and can be omitted in instructions that are not 
			explicitly bound to any other result than the last one. So the following
			two instructions are equivalent:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
				DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $RESULT.id
				DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $id
			</programlisting>
			and so are the following two instructions:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
				FOREACH RESULT DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $RESULT.id
				FOREACH RESULT DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $id
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
			The result name prefix of any named result can also be omitted if the
			instruction is bound to a FOREACH selector naming the result. So the 
			following two statements in the context of an existing database
			result named "ATTRIBUTES" are equivalent:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
				FOREACH ATTRIBUTES DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $ATTRIBUTES.id
				FOREACH ATTRIBUTES DO SELECT name FROM Company WHERE id = $id
			</programlisting>
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Naming Database Results</title>
				<para>Database results can be hold and made referenceable by name
				with the declaration <code>KEEP AS &lt;resultname&gt;</code>
				following immediately the instruction with the result to be referenced.
				The identifier &lt;resultname&gt; references the
				result in a variable reference or a FOREACH selector expression.
				</para>
				<sect4>
				<title>Named Result Example</title>
				<para>This example illustrates how a result is declared by name and referenced:
				<programlisting language='sql'><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_keep_as.tdl" parse="text" />
				</programlisting>
				</para>
				</sect4>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Referencing Subroutine Parameters</title>
				<para>
				Subroutine Parameters are addressed like results but with
				the prefix <code>PARAM.</code> instead of <code>RESULT.</code>
				or a named result prefix. "PARAM." is reserved for parameters.
				The first instruction without FOREACH quantifier can reference
				the parameters without prefix by name.
				<programlisting language='sql'><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_soubroutine_params.tdl" parse="text" />
				</programlisting>
				</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Constraints on Database Results</title>
			<para>Database commands returning results can have constraints to catch
			certain errors that would not be recognized at all or too late otherwise.
			For example a transaction having a result of a previous command as argument
			would not be executed if the result of the previous command is empty.
			Nevertheless the overall transaction would succeed because no database
			error occurring during execution of the commands defined for the 
			transaction.
			</para>
			<para>
			Constraints on database results are expressed as keywords following
			the DO keyword of an instruction in the main processing section.
			</para>
			<para>
			The following list explains the result constraints available:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><code>NONEMPTY</code>
				<para>Declares that the database result for each element of the input
					must not be empty.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem><code>UNIQUE</code>
				<para>Declares that the database result for each element of the input 
					must be unique, if it exists.
					Result sets with more than one element are refused 
					but empty sets are accepted. If you
					want to declare each result to have to exist, 
					you have to put the double constraint
					"UNIQUE NONEMPTY" or "NONEMPTY UNIQUE".</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			</para>
			<sect4>
				<title>Example with Result Constraints</title>
				<para>
				This example illustrates how to add result constraint for
				database commands returning results:
				<programlisting language='sql'>

			<title>Rewriting Error Messages for the Client</title>
			<para>Sometimes internal error messages are confusing and are not helpful
			to the user that does not have a deeper knowledge about the database
			internals. For a set of error types it is possible to add a message
			to be shown to the user if an error of a certain class happens.
			The instruction <code>ON ERROR &lt;errorclass&gt; HINT &lt;message&gt;;</code>
			following a database instruction catches the errors of class &lt;errorclass&gt;
			and add the string &lt;message&gt; to the error message show to the user.
			</para>
			<para>We can have many subsequent ON ERROR definitions in a row if the
			error classes to be caught are various.
			</para>
			<sect4>
			<title>Database Error HINT Example</title>
			<para>The following example shows the usage HINTs in error cases. It
			catches errors that are constraint violations (error class CONSTRAINT)
			and extends the error message with a hint that will be shown to the client as error message:
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_hint.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
			On the client side the following message will be shown:
			<programlisting language='sql'>unique constaint validation in transaction 'insertCustomer'. Customers must have a unique name.
			</programlisting>
			</para>
			</sect4>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Substructures in the Result</title>
			<para>We already learned how to define substructures of the 
			transaction function result with
			the <code>RESULT INTO</code> directive of an OPERATION or 
			TRANSACTION. But <code>RESULT INTO</code> blocks can also be
			defined locally as sub blocks in the main processing block.
			A sub-block in the result is declared with 
			<programlisting language='sql'>

				RESULT INTO &lt;resulttag&gt;
				BEGIN
					...&lt;instruction list&gt;...
				END
			</programlisting>
			All the results of the instruction list that get into the final result
			will be attached to the substructure with name &lt;resulttag&gt;.
			The nesting of result blocks can be arbitrary and the path of the 
			elements in the result follows the scope of the sub-blocks.
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Explicit Definition of Elements in the Result</title>
			<para>The result of a transaction consists normally of database command 
			results that are mapped into the result with the attached INTO directive.
			For printing variable values or constant values you can in certain
			SQL databases use a select constant statement without specifying a table.
			Unfortunately select of constants might not be supported in your 
			database of choice. Besides that explicit printing seems to be much
			more readable. The statement <code>INTO &lt;resulttag&gt; PRINT &lt;value&gt;;</code>
			prints a value that can be a constant, variable or an input or result reference
			into the substructure named &lt;resulttag&gt;. The following artificial 
			example illustrates this.
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_print.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Database Specific Code</title>
			<para>TDL allows the support of different transaction databases with one code base. 
			For example one for testing and demonstration and one for the productive system.
			We can tag transactions,subroutines or whole TDL sources as beeing valid for one or a list of databases
			with the command <code>DATABASE</code> followed by a comma separated list of database names as declared in
			the configuration. The following example declares the transaction function 'getCustomer' to be valid only for
			the databases DB1 and DBtest.
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_database_local.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			The following example does the same but declares the valid databases for the whole TDL file. In this case the database
			declaration has to appear as first declaration in the file.
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_database_global.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Subroutine Templates</title>
			<para>To reuse code with different context, for example for doing the same
			procedure on different tables, subroutine templates can be defined in TDL.
			Subroutines become useful when we want to make items instantiable
			that are not allowed to be dependent on variable arguments.
			Most SQL implementations for example forbid tables to be dependent on
			variable arguments. To reuse code on different tables you can 
			define subroutine templates with the involved table names as 
			template argument. The following example defines a transaction using 
			the template subroutine insertIntoTree on a table passed as template 
			argument.
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_subroutine_template.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3>
			<title>Includes</title>
			<para>TDL has the possibility to include files for reusing subroutines 
			or subroutine templates in different modules.
			The keyword INCLUDE followed by the name of the relative path of the TDL file without the extension .tdl includes the declarations of the included file.
			The declarations in the included file are treated as they would have been
			made in the including file instead.
			The following example swhows the use of include.
			We assume that the subroutine template <code>insertIntoTree</code> 
			of the example before is defined in a separate include file
			<code>treeOperations.tdl</code> located in the same folder as the 
			TDL program.
			<programlisting language='sql'>
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="examples/AppDevelop/example_include.tdl" parse="text" />
			</programlisting>
