	<para>
		A structure in Wolframe is described as serialization sequence of it's equivalent 
		as tree (more precisely forest) with depth first left order traversal. 
		The equivalent of a tree is a tree with leaf nodes representing the 
		atomic values of the structure and non leaf nodes representing sub 
		structures labelled by the non leaf node value. 
		The serialization is a sequence of (element type, element value) 
		tuples with 3 origin element types for describing such a structure. 
		For having a model that is able to cover at least XML there is a 4th 
		element 'Attribute'. A final 'Close' terminates the serialization sequence.

		Each sub structure starts with an <code>Open</code> and ends with a 
		<code>Close</code>. 
	</para>
	<para>
		The end of the serialization is marked with a final <code>Close</code>. 
		That means the the serialization has one <code>Close</code> more (the
		final close) than <code>Open</code> elements.
