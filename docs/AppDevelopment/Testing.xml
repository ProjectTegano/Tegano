<title>Testing and defect handling</title>
<para>In this chapter we learn how parts of a <application>Wolframe</application>
application can be verified to work correctly. The basis for testing and debugging
a <application>Wolframe</application> application is the command line tool 
<application>wolfilter</application>. 
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Using wolfilter</title>
	<para>The command line program <application>wolfilter</application> allows you 
	to call any <application>Wolframe</application> function or filter or mapping 
	into a form structure on command line. The program is mapping stdin or if 
	specified the contents of a file to stdout.
	</para>
	<para>
	The option '--config' (or '-c') specifies the configuration to use, the only argument of the
	wolfilter program specifies the function to call or form to fill. If a dash '-' is
	specified as command then no command is called. The input is just mapped through
	the filters specified. In case of a form or filter mapping, no configuration has
	to be specified.
	</para>
	<para>The following examples assume the input file name to be in.xml or in.json and
	the output file to be named out.xml or out.json respectively.
	</para>
	<sect3>
		<title>Test configuration</title>
		<para>For the examples needing a configuration, we prepare the following simple
		configuration, just declaring the processing stuff, we need. Of course wolfilter
		can also work with any wolframe server configuration. The configuration will be
		referenced as 'test.conf'.
		<programlisting language='text'>
LoadModules
{
    module mod_command_lua
    module mod_doctype_xml
    module mod_filter_libxml2
    module mod_filter_json
    module mod_filter_token
}
Processor
{
    program test.lua
    program myfilter.xslt
    program myform.sfrm
}
		</programlisting>
		</para>

		<title>Testing a filter</title>
		<para>The following example shows the mapping through a libxml2 filter.
		Filters are tested by passing a dash '-' command to execute.
		Because we do not need to load programs, we can call wolfilter without
		a test configuration.
		<programlisting language='sh'>

cat in.xml | wolfilter -e libxml2 -m mod_filter_libxml2 - > out.xml
		</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>The following example shows the processing of the input
		through an xslt filter and mapping the output through a token filter
		that shows the tokenization of the input by the input filter.
		Because the referenced XSLT filter is defined as source in a program,
		we have to specify a configuration (test.conf) that declares the
		programs to load.
		<programlisting language='sh'>

cat in.xml | wolfilter -i myfilter -o token -c test.conf - > out.xml
		</programlisting>
		</para>
	</sect3>

		<title>Testing a Form</title>
		<para>The following example shows the mapping through a form defined with simpleform DDL.
		Mapping through forms is tested by passing the name of the form as command to execute.
		Because forms have to be loaded as programs, we have to specify a 
		configuration (test.conf) too.
		<programlisting language='sh'>

cat in.xml | wolfilter -e libxml2 -c test.conf MyForm > out.xml
		</programlisting>
		we assume here that the form to use is defined in myform.sfrm that is declared
		as program in the configuration and that the form is called MyForm.
		</para>

		<title>Testing a Function</title>
		<para>The following example shows the execution of a function written in Lua.
		A JSON filter is used for input and output.
		<programlisting language='sh'>

cat in.xml | wolfilter -e cjson -c test.conf MyFunc > out.json
		</programlisting>
		we assume here that the exported function to call defined in myfunc.lua 
		declared in test.conf and is called MyFunc.
