Filters describe the transformation of serialized data to a unified serialization of hierarchical structured data and back.
The application does not care about data formats as long as there exists a filter providing
the unified form of serialization.

This chapter describes how filters for different data formats are linked to the logic tier. For each data format
supported by <application>Wolframe</application> one or more filter type is introduced.

<para>
After reading this chapter you should be able to handle different document formats and encodings 
in the logic tier of <application>Wolframe</application>. You will know how to add programs for scriptable filters
