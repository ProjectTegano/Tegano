	<title>Auditing And Accounting</title>
	<para>The aspect of auditing and accounting is configured in the 
	subsection <code>Audit</code> of the <code>AAAA</code> section
	in the server configuration. Accounting is a sub aspect of
	auditing. The audit (and accounting) calls are implemented as normal
	Wolframe function calls. The configuration defines additional parameters
	depending on the authentication status for the audit function calls 
	and resources to be referenced.

	The following example shows an <code>Audit</code>
	configuration with the setting use the textfile /var/tmp/wolframe.audit
	as audit log:
	<programlisting language='text'>
AAAA
{
    Audit
    {
        TextFile
        {
            file /var/tmp/wolframe.audit
        }
    }
}
	</programlisting>
	</para>
	<sect2>
	<title>Development status</title>
		<para>The mechanism of auditing, the calling of audit functions
		and their declaration in the transaction layer is implemented
		and tested. The underlaying methods, for example to log
		to a text file as configured in the example above is not yet
		implemented, but is subject of the next release.</para>
