			AAAA is an acronym for authentication,authorization,
			accounting and auditing.
			The different aspects of AAAA in the application are
			linked together as they all are based on the identity
			of the user. The identitiy of a user is authenticated 
			after his login. Depending on the identity and the method
			the user was authenticated, he gets privileges to access
			resources or execute procedures. Wolframe provides
			hooks for calling authorization to enforce checks of
			these privileges. Every request and every transaction 
			can be bound to authorization. Every function executed
			can use authorization functions to check privileges.
		</para>

			Accounting and auditing functions use the identity
			of the user to log the actions of a session.

		<para>
			Wolframe defines authentification methods as 
			configurable modules. New modules can be added easily.
			Authorization and auditing calls are implemented as ordinary
			functions that can be written in any language that
			has bindings for Wolframe. A layer inbetween declares
			what data of the users context is passed to authorization
			or audit/accounting functions. This makes it easy to
			enforce rules how to handle sensible login data in a
			controlled way.
