	<title>Authorization</title>
	<para>The aspect of authorization is configured in the 
	subsection <code>Authorization</code> of the <code>AAAA</code> section
	in the server configuration.
	Authorization in Wolframe has two levels. The first level is authorization
	based on connection info, e.g. is a client allowed/denied to connect
	from a certain ip range. Connection info based authorization happens on
	connect to the server. The second level is command execution authorization
	that happens on execution of a function or on access of some resources 
	based on authentication info and connection info.

		<para>The authorization based on connection info is not
		implemented yet. Authorization based on connection info
		will be a subject of the next release.
		The only working configuration is the
		default <code>Authorization</code> configuration with 
		the setting to allow access to anybody authenticated 
		that is not explicitely denied:
		<programlisting language='text'>
AAAA
{
    Authorization
    {
        Authorization {
            default allow
        }
    }
}
		</programlisting>
		</para>

	<title>Command execution authorization</title>
		<sect3>
		<title>Development status</title>
		<para>The command execution authorization is not implemented 
		yet completely. The idea is to have programs that map
		authorization function calls to Wolframe function calls.
		The language to describe these programs is not yet defined.
		The mechanism to map the authorize requests to the function
		calls already exists.
		Authorization based on command execution
		will be a subject of the next release.
