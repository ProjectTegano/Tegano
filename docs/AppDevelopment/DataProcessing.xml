		In the this chapter we will see how application
		server requests look like.
		We will have a look at the <application>Wolframe</application>
		standard command handler that handles the requests 
		and how it is configured.
		Then we will show how to write programs that declare the functions 
		executing the requests and how you link them to your application.
		Finally we will describe the tools available in Wolframe
		for defect handling and testing.
