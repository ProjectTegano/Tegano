	<title>AAAA configuration</title>
	<para>The aspects of authentication,authorization,auditing and accounting
	are defined in different sections of the configuration.
	Connection based authorization for example that defines from where we can
	connect is configured as part of the listener configurations
	as IP restrictions (see chapter 'Server configuration').
	An other example are authorization functions that a called in the 
	processing engine to determine wheter a user is allowed to execute a 
	function, to access a resource, etc. These functions are defined in
	programs configured in the Processing section.

	<para>
	For defining the units and resources involved in AAAA, we define the 
	section <code>AAAA</code> of the server configuration.
	The following example shows an empty <code>AAAA</code> configuration
	section:
	<programlisting language='text'>
AAAA
{
    ;... configuration for 
    ;    authentication,authorization,auditing and accounting
}
	</programlisting>
	</para>
