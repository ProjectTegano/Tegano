		<para>You can write functions for the logic tier of <application>Wolframe</application> in languages based
		on <application>.NET</application> (<ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/net">http://www.microsoft.com/net</ulink>) like for example
		<application>C#</application> and <application>VB.NET</application>.  
		Because <application>.NET</application> based libraries can only be called 
		by <application>Wolframe</application> only as a 
		compiled and not as an interpreted language, you have to build a module out of your function 
		implementation.
		</para>
		<para>
		The implementation of <application>.NET</application> calls is not yet available.
		The implementation exists as prove of concept in a test program. 
		But <application>Wolframe</application> will provide
		<application>.NET</application> functions soon.
