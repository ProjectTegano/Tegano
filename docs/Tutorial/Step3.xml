	<para>
		Now that we have ensured that basic connectivity to the Wolframe server
		is available, we can configure the basics for the Qt client.
	</para>

	<para>
		We start the Qt client with:

		<programlisting language='shell'>
	wolfclient -c tutorial.conf
		</programlisting>
	</para>
		
	<para>
		First define your connection by selecting "Manage Connections" in
		the "Connection" menu. Define a new connection called "tutorial"
		which connects to server "localhost" on port 7661. Leave the
		SSL connection unchecked.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Now you can try to login to your server by selection "Connection"
		and then "Login" in the menu.	
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Because we didn't write any user interfaces yet, we get
		an error message:
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	Unable to load form 'init', does it exist?
		</programlisting>
		
		To get rid of that error message we will have to create
		our start form in the Qt designer first. For now we just
		click away the error message.
	</para>
				
	<para>
		We start now the Qt designer and create an empty QWidget form named
		<filename>~/tutorial/client/init.ui</filename> and save it.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		If we restart the client and login in we see the same empty window again,
		but this time it's the dynamically loaded initial form
		(which is again empty). The previous error message disappeared.
	</para>
