	<para>
		Now that we have ensured that basic connectivity to the Wolframe server
		is available, we can configure the basics for the Qt client.
	</para>

	<para>
		We start the Qt client with:

		<programlisting language='shell'>
	qtclient -s tutorial.conf -d
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	
	<para>
		On first run we get presented a preferences dialog.
		Just accept the defaults.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		When terminating the client you will find a settings
		file called <filename>~/tutorial/client/client.conf</filename>:
		
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	[wolframe]
	host=localhost
	port=7661
	secure=false
	checkSSL=true
	client-cert-file=./certs/client.crt
	client-key-file=./private/client.key
	ca-cert-file=./certs/CAclient.cert.pem
	uiloadmode=LocalFile
	dataloadmode=Network
	dbname=./data.db
	debug=false
	uiFormDir=.
	uiFormTranslationsDir=.
	uiFormResourcesDir=.
	dataLoaderDir=.
	locale=en_US
		</programlisting>
	</para>
		
	<para>
		We get a login screen were we just hit the "Login" button.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Because we didn't write any user interfaces yet, we get
		an error message:
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	Unable to load form 'init', does it exist?
		</programlisting>
		
		To get rid of that error message we will have to create
		our start form in the Qt designer first. For now we just
		click away the error message.
	</para>
			
	<para>
		We get an empty window, we can go to "Help", "Debug Terminal". Also
		here we can test the protocol as in a telnet client.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Type <userinput>quit</userinput>, then <keycap>Enter</keycap>
		in the debug window or exit the Qt application over the menu.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		We start now the Qt designer and create an empty QWidget form named
		<filename>~/tutorial/client/init.ui</filename> and save it.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		If we start the client now we see the same empty window again,
		but this time it's the dynamically loaded initial form
		(which is again empty). And the previous error message disappeared.
	</para>
