	<title>Step 2 - Basic Authorization</title>	

	<para>
		So we have to add a dummy authorization to the server configuration
		which accepts all connections (not very secure, but for now good enough):
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	; dummy authorization
	AAAA {
		Authorization {
			default allow
		}
	}
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	
	<para>
		If we start the server now, the telnet shows us:
		
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Wolframe
	OK
		</programlisting>
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Type <userinput>quit</userinput>, then <keycap>Enter</keycap>
		now and get back to the shell:
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	BYE
	Connection closed by foreign host.
		</programlisting>
	</para>

	<para>
		The server in the shell shows the following output indicating
		that authorization was successful:
		
		<programlisting language='shell'>
	DEBUG: Connection from 127.0.0.1:47064 to 0.0.0.0:7661 authorized
	DEBUG: Connection to 127.0.0.1:47064 closed
		</programlisting>

	</para>
