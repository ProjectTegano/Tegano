WOLFRAME-PAM authentication protocol

Client and server agreed on the 'WOLFRAME-PAM' mech.

1.  The client immediately sends the username in plain

2.a If the PAM system accepts the user without password the server
    authenticates the user (SLICE_AUTHENTICATED) and the protocol
    terminates
   
2.b If the PAM system doesn't accept the user the server doesn't
    authenticate the user (SLICE_INVALID_CREDENTIALS) and the protocol
    terminates

3.  If the PAM system requires a password from the user it sends the
    message 'password?' to the client

4.  The client sends the password (in plain)

5.  The server authenticates the user now (SLICE_AUTHENTICATED) or
    not (SLICE_INVALID_CREDENTIALS)
