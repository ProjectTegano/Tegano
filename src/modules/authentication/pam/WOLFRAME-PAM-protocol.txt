WOLFRAME-PAM authentication protocol

Client and server agreed on the 'WOLFRAME-PAM' mech.

1.  The client immediately sends the username in plain

2.a If the PAM system accepts the user without password the server
    authenticates the user (AUTHENTICATED) and the protocol
    terminates
   
2.b If the PAM system doesn't accept the user the server doesn't
    authenticate the user (INVALID_CREDENTIALS) and the protocol
    terminates
    
2.c If the PAM system doesn't know the user, the system is signalled
    accordingly (USER_NOT_FOUND)

3.  If the PAM system requires a password from the user it sends the
    message 'password?' to the client

4.  The client sends the password (in plain)

5.  The server authenticates the user now (AUTHENTICATED) or
    not (INVALID_CREDENTIALS), also it signals if the user is
    unknown (USER_NOT_FOUND)
