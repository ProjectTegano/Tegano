- minimal config is a config with 2 config elements?! weird..
  => check for XML first, use some simple validating parser (Patrick has one)
- inconsistent nameing of configuration parameters (lowercase, uppercase,
  camelcase, etc.)
  - Processor, database
- existence of files is not checked, e.g.
  - directmap, program directive
  - on the other hand simpleforms are checked
- syntax in files not checked on startup, only on first execution:
  lua, directmap
