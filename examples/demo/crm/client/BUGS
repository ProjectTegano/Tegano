------ Tutorial page 3: Used unknwon option -d and -c
"qtclient -s tutorial.conf -d"
instead of
"qtclient -c tutorial.conf"

"When terminating the client you will find a settings file called ~/tutorial/client/

------ Tutorial page 4:
??? We get a login screen were we just hit the "Login" button.
I found a login and could establish a connection, but the tutorial is not up to date.

------ Reload main window without any form defined:
??? Unable to load form '', does it exist?

--
Use no action, not action='Request'
--
global.customerState instead of global.customer.State (global is a global
widget it can't hold subobjects, only variables)
--
doctype should not have a 'xxxx.simpleform', the implementation of
the doctype (simpleform,lua,..) should be hidden from the client!
--
no action mode bugs:

delete gets:
<!DOCTYPE customer SYSTEM 'DeleteCustomer.simpleform'>
<customer id="6">
  <customer id="6">Z</customer>
  <horizontalGroupBox/>
</customer>

this is because the rootelement and the customer list have the same
name. The add case and update case need this, as the root element there
must be 'customer' and the fields are the properties of 'customer'.

so read/delete have the "only root, no mapping of subwidget"-semantics, as no data
is being sent down to the server, only dedicated properties like 'id'
as attributes of the root element.

update/write have "root and subwidget as sub-elements" semantic.

=> can't get rid of action/initAction in the current model without explicit
   mapping of widget names to XML entitities
