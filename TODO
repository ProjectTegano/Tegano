ABa:
daemon code:
- On expection in main, remove pidfile -> permission issue, need root
  parent with signalling, see WolfBones, or maybe chown of pidfile?
- qtclient cont.
- configurator
  - categories + features, trees with add/delete/edit
  - image picker
  - associatiting features and categories

- makefiles
  - fix libchrono transitive dependency in boost in 1.50/1.51
  - error checking after dependency generation, avoid funny mistakes

- polish deployment
  - template configuration wolframed.conf
  - debian builds always against 1.48 boost, this should only be the
    case for older Debian/Ubuntu systems (needs a split in OSC dsc
    files)
  - local deployed boost libaries (1.48) for Debian and old Ubuntu have
    to be bundled with wolframe-libclient too. They must be in a common
    dependency like 'wolframe-boost-rt'
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu is a possible module loading place,
    so is /usr/lib32, /usr/lib64, etc. inject as MODULEPATH to build
    process and to module loading code 
  - apache-like LoadModules, support for 'wolframe.d/libxml2.conf'
    and 'include wolframe.d/*.conf'
  - systemd instead of init scripts for Fedora and Archlinux
  - wolframe depends on libicu48, this is wrong as boost-localization
    should layer the functionality and icu is only a backend

- documentation
  - man pages


PF:
- high prio
  - Web Page Templates
  - Project CRM
  - Lua functions for directmap (struct IN table OUT)
  - test forms with SELF recursion and inheritance
  - '_' as content identifier in .NET results
  - UIForm loader in client and server

- low prio
  - XSLT templates for ui form generation wizard
  - auditing extensions for Transactions (at end of transaction)
  - Python bindings
  - error objects for exceptions/logging (non intrusive: bind_int, etc.)
  - bignum tests (only bigint tested until now)
  - XSLT filter + tests
  - .NET call
  - Printing with HPDF
    - The print form configuration can have an xslt script for preprocessing
