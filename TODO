MBa:

2. propagate symbols through makefiles
xxxx. SSL must require certificate from peer if verify is on


ABa:

1. synchronize boost-log with 1.0 version in SVN on sourceforge,
   provide feedback to the author:
   - gcc flags and related bugs:
     - -Wshadow
   - the process id should be convertible to an int for printing

2. finish LUA processor
   - compose tables as parameters (like SSL, connection peer data)
   - pass log level to LUA module (for debug messages)
   - solve the default folder problem in services (echo.lua
     is currently searched in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32)
   - configuration passing?

PF:

1. TA processor

?. backport the module loader from Wolfbones/TextWolf,
   especially interesting for servers and handler in funny languages
