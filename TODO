ABa:
daemon code:
- On expection in main, remove pidfile -> permission issue, need root
  parent with signalling, see WolfBones, or maybe chown of pidfile?
- qtclient cont.
- configurator
  - categories + features, trees with add/delete/edit
  - image picker
  - associatiting features and categories

- makefiles
  - fix libchrono transitive dependency in boost in 1.50/1.51
  - error checking after dependency generation, avoid funny mistakes
  - parallel builds in lua and qtclient fail, lib, cmdline

PF:
- configurator
  - sqlite schemas, scripts
    - products

- high prio
  - input:table() hangs in function_input_table (lua_touserdata)
  - UIForm loader in client and server
  - change definition of doctype (table). pass string or table or filter to output:as
  - documentation (tutorial)
  - split tests to execute postgres tests only when database is running (decided in makefile)

- low prio
  - cmdline client: test with SSL (look at boost asio SSL client example with socket)
       -- openssl s_server -accept 7961 -cert tests/SSL/wolframed.crt -key tests/SSL/wolframed.key -state
  - test forms with SELF recursion
  - programs with interface (cleanup ProcProvider)
  - bignum tests (only bigint tested until now)
  - XSLT filter + tests
  - Printing with HPDF
    - The print form configuration can have an xslt script for preprocessing
