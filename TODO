MBa:

- SSL must require certificate from peer if verify is on


ABa:

- authentication
  - LDAP
  - AD/Windows Kerberos
  - SASL
- makefiles
  - merge po stuff from WolfBones with the funny script in po :-)
  - warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR in src (because we
    link the library and the executable twice with library dependencies,
    we should link only the resulting binary, this is exactly the
    opposite of shared libraries on Unix)
- Windows:
  - username, password for service credentials
  - clean up native Win32 string mess in service code
  - log when service gets installed and uninstalled
  - do some packaging with Wix
    - have merge modules for all optional parts (should be do
      merge modules for OpenSSL? legal?)
- Logger:
  - get better interface in logger.hpp (inheriting basic::ostream
    instead of templating?)
- 64-bit on Windows
  - trouble with Qt
- *BSD
  - OpenPAM instead of Linux-PAM
  - Qt not tested so far
  - trouble with some expect tests, check!
- packaging
  - SLES
    ... testing for pre/postinstall scripts that are not idempotent
