MBa:

- SSL must require certificate from peer if verify is on
- * in network interface definition should add BOTH ipv4 and ipv6 IPs


ABa:

- wolfcli
  - netcat with authentication and SSL
- authentication
  - redo interface (now in Attic)
  - then plugins for
    - LDAP
    - AD/Windows Kerberos
    - SASL
- makefiles
  - wolframed is build over and over again. mix of real and phony
    target because of parallel builds and dependencies. don't know
    how to solve it
  - warning LNK4006: __NULL_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR in src (because we
    link the library and the executable twice with library dependencies,
    we should link only the resulting binary, this is exactly the
    opposite of shared libraries on Unix)
- Windows:
  - username, password for service credentials
  - clean up native Win32 string mess in service code
  - log when service gets installed and uninstalled
- Logger:
  - get better interface in logger.hpp (inheriting basic::ostream
    instead of templating? or boost streams or boost:log)
- FreeBSD
  - OpenPAM instead of Linux-PAM
- packaging
  - OSC
    - Debian release (squeeze/sid) into deb package name
    - OSC revision and build number in deb package name
