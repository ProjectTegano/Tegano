MBa:


ABa:
daemon code:
- On expection in main, remove pidfile -> permission issue, need root
  parent with signalling, see WolfBones, or maybe chown of pidfile?
- qtclient cont.
- configurator
  - categories + features, trees with add/delete/edit
  - image picker
  - associatiting features and categories

- makefiles
  - fix libchrono transitive dependency in boost in 1.50/1.51
  - error checking after dependency generation, avoid funny mistakes

- polish deployment
  - template configuration wolframed.conf
  - generate and install manpages, finish text
  - debian builds always against 1.48 boost, this should only be the
    case for older Debian/Ubuntu systems (needs a split in OSC dsc
    files)
  - local deployed boost libaries (1.48) for Debian and old Ubuntu have
    to be bundled with wolframe-libclient too.
  - Debian: add -dev packages, but how to do this nicely having just
    one rule file and one 'make install'?
    
PF:
- high prio
  - UIForm loader in client and server

- low prio
  - test forms with SELF recursion
  - auditing extensions for Transactions
  - error objects for exceptions/logging (non intrusive: bind_int, etc.)
  - bignum tests (only bigint tested until now)
  - XSLT filter + tests
  - .NET call
  - Printing with HPDF
    - The print form configuration can have an xslt script for preprocessing

- nice to have
  - Transactions: Warning for unused results
