  - netcat with authentication and SSL
- authentication
  - redo interface (now in Attic)
  - then plugins for
    - LDAP
    - AD/Windows Kerberos
    - SASL
- makefiles
  - wolframed is build over and over again. mix of real and phony
    target because of parallel builds and dependencies. don't know
    how to solve it
- Logger:
  - get better interface in logger.hpp (inheriting basic::ostream
    instead of templating? or boost streams or boost:log)
- FreeBSD
  - OpenPAM instead of Linux-PAM
- packaging
  - OSC
    - Debian release (squeeze/sid) into deb package name
    - OSC revision and build number in deb package name
  - Windows
    - read XML properties during change/repair
    - custom actions need C merge modules
