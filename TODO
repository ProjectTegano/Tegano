MBa:

- propagate symbols through makefiles
- SSL must require certificate from peer if verify is on


ABa:

- makefiles
  - do some Linux distribution autodetection
  - do automatic layout for includes and libraries for Linux
- logger
  - add a prefix for logging in subparts of the system (e.g. network, luaprocessor),
    map it to ident for syslog, source for eventlog
- Windows:
  - username, password for service credentials
  - clean up native Win32 string mess in service code
- lua processor:
  - smerplogger.dll/.so: linking is currently delicate, to say the least!
    also we have a singleton problem with the logger, it seems..
- 64-bit on Windows, issues with Qt, boost at least
