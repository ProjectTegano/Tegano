OPEN SOURCE PRODUCT MUSTS:
Core:
	- Connection handling reorganization of existing code (MBa)
	- Context for processors in provider (MBa & PF)
	- AAAA stuff to a certain level (MBa, support for protocol PF)
	- Client UI files from server with protocol support as ordinary wolframe function call - eliminate process specific stuff from core (PF & MBa)
	- For different type of transactions (get UI files, process request, etc..) chose DB in context
Processors:
	- TDL tests with random programs of big complexity (PF)
	- Python (ABa, with support PF)
	- Custom data type documentation and BigFxp tests (PF)
Build&Deployment:
	- Build and deployment and OS support (pkg mgmt) for update process (ABa, MBa)

Fixes:
	- Cleanup types::DocType mess
	- Document type recognition & format guesser module
	- Rewrite Simpleform Compiler (Parsing)
	- Start SDK and splitting of graphix module and others

OPEN SOURCE PRODUCT NICE TO HAVE:
- Printing (impl + documentation)


TO THINK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE:
Add namespaces to TDL,Lua (special global variable in Lua script)
Python (check how module names = namespaces are set when embeding python)
