MBa:


ABa:
- Qt frontend
  - qtclient cont.
  - configurator
    - categories + features, trees with add/delete/edit
    - image picker
    - associatiting features and categories
    - see separate list in clients/qt/TODOS
    
- makefiles
  - fix libchrono transitive dependency in boost in 1.50/1.51
  - error checking after dependency generation, avoid funny mistakes

- polish deployment
  - OpenSuse Build Service:
    - Ubuntu 13.04 OSC: missing libboost-locale1.49-dev?!
      => disabled WITH_ICU for now
  - template configuration wolframed.conf for all platforms, different
    layouts at least for:
    - ArchLinux: all in one, annotated, KISS
    - Debian: includes and split
    - Redhat: includes and split, other pathes than Debian
  - local deployed boost libaries (1.48) for Debian and old Ubuntu have
    to be bundled with wolframe-libclient too. They must be in a common
    dependency like 'wolframe-boost-rt'
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu is a possible module loading place,
    so is /usr/lib32, /usr/lib64, etc. inject as MODULEPATH to build
    process and to module loading code 
  - wolframe depends on libicu48, this is wrong as boost-localization
    should layer the functionality and icu is only a backend
    (this is due to mistakes in debhelper shlibs detection on Debian/Ubuntu
    only)
  - use simple include for per-sub-package snippets for now till
    we get a glob-include in configuration files,
    apache-like LoadModules, support for 'wolframe.d/libxml2.conf'
    and 'include wolframe.d/*.conf'
  - test module default dir, make 'directory' override the #ifdef-ed one,
    test everywhere
    also, don't give up after one guess, try to combine the package root (optional)
    and then the server root (the location of the configuration)
  - avoid building of things like mod_test in tests directory if not building
    the tests (they are not deployed):
    - split rules for building loadable modules and test loadable modules (mod_test)
    - build TEST_XXX only if 'make test' is given, not in 'make all'
  
- documentation
  - man pages


PF:
- OPERATIONS return only one row (for $n to work), much better
  is to return the whole result and say that the last row gets
  mapped to $n variables,
  alternative, make 'INTO a/b DO' work, maybe as
  WITH a DO
    INTO b DO SELECT ...
  END

- high prio
  - Widget visitor in QtClient
  - PHP client with SSL
  - Counter to check for loop forever in all filter STMs
  - Web Page Templates
  - Project CRM
  - Lua functions for directmap (struct IN table OUT)
  - test forms with SELF recursion and inheritance
  - '_' as content identifier in .NET results
  - UIForm loader in client and server

- low prio
  - XSLT templates for ui form generation wizard
  - auditing extensions for Transactions (at end of transaction)
  - Python bindings
  - error objects for exceptions/logging (non intrusive: bind_int, etc.)
  - bignum tests (only bigint tested until now)
  - XSLT filter + tests
  - .NET call
  - Printing with HPDF
    - The print form configuration can have an xslt script for preprocessing
