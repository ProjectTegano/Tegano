MBa:


ABa:
daemon code:
- On expection in main, remove pidfile -> permission issue, need root
  parent with signalling, see WolfBones, or maybe chown of pidfile?
- qtclient cont.
- configurator
  - categories + features, trees with add/delete/edit
  - image picker
  - associatiting features and categories

- makefiles
  - fix libchrono transitive dependency in boost in 1.50/1.51
  - error checking after dependency generation, avoid funny mistakes
  - parallel builds in lua and qtclient fail, lib, cmdline

PF:
- configurator
  - sqlite schemas, scripts
    - products
- high prio
  - UIForm loader in client and server
  - remove smart ptr from database (sqlite)

- bugs
  - scope(itr) passed to form does not consume all input
     (check if form could not consume final close and check if the
      implementation does not onyl respect the top level tag as side effect)
  - tostring,table,get are not copying their iterated object (missing TypedInputFilter::copy())

- low prio
  - cmdline client: test with SSL (MBA)
  - Lua: make form:fill() also return the form filled so that assigning and filling can be chained
  - test forms with SELF recursion
  - programs with interface (cleanup ProcProvider)
  - documentation (tutorial)
  - bignum tests (only bigint tested until now)
  - XSLT filter + tests
  - Printing with HPDF
    - The print form configuration can have an xslt script for preprocessing
