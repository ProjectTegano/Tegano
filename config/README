modularized    - for platform with split module packages (RHEL/Fedora, SUSE, Debian,
                 Ubuntu)
monolythic     - for platforms where there is one 'wolframe' package (Slackware,
                 FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris)

style guide:
- visible on 79x24 terminal
- no tabs, use 4 spaces
- minimal documentation, main documentation goes to man page,
  explanations and examples got to Wolfbook
- default options and modules should require as little external
  libraries as possible, for instance mod_db_sqlite3 should not
  be enabled by default neither in the monolythic nor in the
  modularized confiugration (the later has a separate config snippet,
  the former is per default commented out)
